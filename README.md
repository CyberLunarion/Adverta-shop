# Advert Shop Website by Dmitrij Orlov

This website was made for creating and managing advertisements for anything you may want to sell.

Unfortunately I wasn't able to fully implement the Account Auth system into the frontend, but the backend is fully done and works flawlessly.

Here are the steps you must follow to launch the website correctly:

- Open the main folder through VSCode.
- Open a new terminal.
- Type in "cd ./backend".
- Then "npm run dev".
- Open a new terminal again (Do not close the current one).
- Type in "cd ./frontend".
- Then "npm run dev".
- CTRL + Left Click on the Url that appears in the terminal to access the website.
- Done!
